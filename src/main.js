//We want a factory function for creating the ships that our players will use, this factory would have properties on it like the type of ship, size/length of the ship. We want methods in this ship factory that allow for the ships to take damage, for example in the instance that a ship gets clicked on, we want to add a hit counter to it. This ship and its data would be an object.

//the factory should also have a method on it to check if the players ship is sunk. This would be a boolean value that checks the number of hits it has recieved against the length of the ship. 

import { Ship } from "./shipModule";
